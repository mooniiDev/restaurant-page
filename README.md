# The Odin Project JavaScript
## Project: Restaurant Page
  I continue practicing **DOM manipulation** by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage. I am using **JavaScript alone** to generate the entire contents of the website. The project is from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).
